What is the OSI model and its purpose in networking?
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a framework used in networking to
understand how different network protocols interact and communicate with each other. 
It divides the process of network communication into seven layers, each with a specific function:

1. **Physical Layer**: Handles the physical connection between devices.
2. **Data Link Layer**: Manages data transfer between two connected nodes.
3. **Network Layer**: Directs data between different networks.
4. **Transport Layer**: Ensures data is delivered error-free and in the correct order.
5. **Session Layer**: Manages sessions or connections between devices.
6. **Presentation Layer**: Translates data into a format the application layer can understand.
7. **Application Layer**: Provides network services directly to the user's applications.
The purpose of the OSI model is to standardize networking protocols and help different systems communicate, 
making it easier to design and troubleshoot networks. It was created to promote interoperability and guide 
the development of networking protocols.

 ⁬Explain the TCP/IP model.
TCP/IP Model Kya Hai?
TCP/IP model aik framework hai jo yeh samajhne mein madad karta hai ke internet aur doosri networks par data kis tarah se transmit hota hai. 
Yeh model data communication ke mushkil process ko chaar layers mein divide karta hai, jismein har ek layer ka apna specific role hota hai.

1. Application Layer
Yeh sabse upar wali layer hai jahan aap applications se interact karte hain, jaise ke web browsers, email clients aur doosri software. 
Is layer mein protocols shaamil hain, jaise HTTP (web browsing ke liye), FTP (file transfer ke liye), aur SMTP (email ke liye). 
Yeh layer handle karti hai ke applications network par kaise communicate karte hain.
2. Transport Layer
Transport layer yeh ensure karti hai ke data reliably send aur receive ho. Is mein TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) aur UDP (User Datagram Protocol) shaamil hain. 
TCP yeh ensure karta hai ke data correct order mein aur bina error ke pohonche, jabke UDP tezi se data send karta hai lekin woh itni reliability nahi deta. 
Yeh layer data flow aur error checking ko manage karti hai.
3. Internet Layer
Yeh layer zimmedar hoti hai data ko mukhtalif networks par move karne ke liye. Is mein IP (Internet Protocol) use hota hai jo data packets ko unke 
destination tak route karta hai. Yeh layer addressing (jaise IP addresses) aur routing handle karti hai, aur yeh ensure karti hai ke data sender se receiver tak sahi raste par jaye.
4. Network Access Layer
Sabse neeche wali layer hai jo physical hardware aur connections ko manage karti hai jinke zariye data transmit hota hai. Is mein protocols shaamil 
hain jo local network ke andar data transfer ko manage karte hain, jaise ke Ethernet aur Wi-Fi. Yeh layer data ko actual hardware, jaise ke cables, 
switches aur wireless signals par send karne ka zimma uthati hai.
Differentiate between a hub and a switch.

Define IP addressing.
IP addressing ko samajhna aasan hai. Har device jo internet ya kisi network se connect hoti hai, usko ek unique number milta hai jise "IP address" 
kehte hain. 

### IP Address Kya Hai?
IP address ek aisa number hota hai jo kisi bhi device (jaise computer, mobile, ya router) ko identify karta hai. Yeh number 4 parts mein divide hota 
hai, aur har part 0 se 255 tak koi bhi number ho sakta hai. Misal ke taur par, ek IP address aisa ho sakta hai: **192.168.1.1**.

### IP Address Ki Zaroorat Kyu Hai?
Jab aap internet par kuch send ya receive karte hain, to IP address help karta hai yeh decide karne mein ke data kahan jaana hai. Har device ka IP 
address unique hota hai, isliye data sahi jagah par pohonchta hai. Yeh bilkul usi tarah hai jaise aapke ghar ka postal address, jo aapke ghar ko identify
 karta hai taake cheezein sahi jagah par delivery ho sakein.

What is subnetting?
Subnetting aik technique hai jo ek bade network ko chhote subnets mein divide karti hai. Isse IP addresses ko efficiently use kiya ja sakta hai 
aur network ko behtar manage aur secure kiya ja sakta hai. For example, ek IP range ko chhote blocks mein divide karna taake har block specific 
devices ke liye use ho sake.
